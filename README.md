# Binary_Tree
Binary Tree Boilerplate

Binary Tree infrastructure along with Queues one 
In order to display the trees content,we implemented a queue,a temporarily 
buffer for display
The Queue each time enqueue a whole "struct noeud" and checks if that 
cell has a "left" and "right" cells ,if it does it will enqueue both of 
them and so on..
